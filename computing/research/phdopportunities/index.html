<p><strong><a name="reasoneng"></a>A reasoning engine to take decision with vague, conflicting and uncertain Information. Extending Abstract Argumentation to Graded and Vague Concepts.</strong></p>
<p>Two ubiquitous characteristics of human decisions are the following: they often happen in situation of conflicting information and the concepts involved in the process are often vague and partially true. Practitioners in AI have developed sophisticated systems to manage uncertainty in decisions-making. Multi-valued and fuzzy logic are suitable to model vague and partially true information, while recent works in Abstract Argumentation Theory have produced a set elegant and sound semantics to manage conflicts resolution between conflicting evidence. However, Abstract argumentation is only able to deal with Boolean evidence, and it has little or no support for any sort of fuzzy, uncertain or partially true argument. On the other side, fuzzy logic systems do not embed any mechanisms of conflict resolution comparable with the ones produced by Abstract Argumentation. The aim of this PhD project is to extend the state-of-the-art of reasoning system by investigating how fuzzy reasoning can be integrated into abstract argumentation theory. The challenges are to define a framework with the following characteristics: sound in the decisions produced, able to explain and justify its decisions, able to integrate different multi-valued logic semantics, and computationally feasible. The framework will be integrated with complementary uncertainty management approach, such as probability and possibility theory. Implemented version of the framework will be evaluated in a diverse set of fields such as clinical decision making process and financial risk assessment.</p>

<p><strong><a name="repta"></a>Exploring Representation in Text Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Feature representation of textual content can vary from the traditional Bag-of-Words through word and character n-grams through feature ehanced representations such as Latent Semantic Indexing and more recently word embeddings available from deep learning type implementations such as wordtovec. &nbsp; The object of this project is to explore the impact of different representations on typical text analytics applications such as topic modelling, sentiment analysis or document classification. &nbsp;One focus of the investigation and exploration is to consider the feasibility and practical application of different representations in a real world environment faced by challenges such as response time, multi-language etc.</p>

<p><strong><a name="qccrowdsourcing"></a>Quality Control in Crowdsourcing</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online crowdsourcing enables tasks to be performed by a large number of people.&nbsp; There are a variety of micro working platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, which provide crowdsourcing services. &nbsp; Workers are normally rewarded with a payment reward for completing tasks.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tasks normally require human input and can vary from elementary basic tasks such as labelling images or translating a phrase to more complex tasks that may require expert knowledge such as diagnosis from images.&nbsp; A major challenge with crowdsourcing is to ensure good quality work for the available budget.&nbsp; &nbsp; Research (e.g., Marge, Banerjee, and Rudnicky 2010) has shown that there is no correlation between the payment reward and the final quality as increasing the price is believed to attract spammers (e.g. those who cheat by answering randomly to get the payment).</p>
<p>&nbsp;There are a variety of quality control mechanisms in play in crowdsourcing such as pre-work tests, statistical filtering, using expert review or using worker reputation.&nbsp; &nbsp; The objective of this project is to explore the question of how to get the best quality outcomes in crowdsourcing scenarios.</p>

<p><strong><a name="contextualannotation"></a>Contextual Annotation of Unstructured Text</strong></p>
<p>With the advances in social media and online frameworks for user generated content there is an explosion of online content, photos, videos, blogs, etc.&nbsp; Most of the non textual online content has associated unstructured text labels or comments which can provide additional context. &nbsp; This context is useful for a variety of use cases, e.g. to facilitate the categorisation of online content or to facilitate ontology population in specific domains.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>This project focusses on exploring mechanisms to annotate and enrich unstructured textual content to provide additional relevant context.&nbsp; The project will involve research in a variety of areas including natural language processing, named entity recognition, linked open data, automatic annotation and ontology construction.</p>

<p><strong><a name="decmakingarg"></a>Enhancing Decision Making with Argumentation Theory<br /></strong></p>
<p>Argumentation theory (AT) is a new important multi-disciplinary topic in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that incorporates element of philosophy, psychology and sociology and that studies how people reason and express their arguments. It systematically investigates how arguments can be built, sustained or discarded in a defeasible reasoning process and the validity of the conclusions reached through resolutions of potential inconsistencies. Because of its simplicity and modularity compared to other reasoning approaches, AT has gaining importance for enhancing decision-making. This project aims to study the impact of defeasible reasoning and formal models of argumentation theory for supporting and enhancing decision-making. Multiple fields of application will be tested against state-of-the-art approaches: decision-making in health care, multi-agent systems, trust and the Web.</p>

<p><strong><a name="mentalwl"></a>Mental Workload and Usability Methods for enhancing Web Design<br /></strong></p>
<p>The demands of evaluating usability of interactive systems have produced, in the last decades, various assessment procedures. Often, in the context of web-design, when selecting an appropriate procedure, it is desirable to take into account the required effort and expense to collect and analyse data. For this reason, web-designers have tended to adopt cheap subjective usability assessment techniques for enhancing their systems. However, there is a tendency to overlook aspects of the context and characteristics of the users during the usability assessment process. For instance, assessing usability in testing environments is different than assessing it in operational environments. Similarly, a skilled person is likely to perceive usability differently than an unexperienced person. For this reason the notion of performance is acquiring importance for enhancing web-design. However, assessing performance is not a trivial task and many computational methods and measurement techniques have been proposed. One importance construct that is strictly connected to performance is human Mental Workload (MWL). (often referred to as Cognitive Workload). Several MWL assessment procedures have beed proposed in the literature but a measure that can be applied for web-design is lacking. Similarly, recent studies have tried to employ the concept of MWL jointly with the notion of usability. However, despite this interest, not much has been done to link these two concepts together and investigate their relationship.</p>
<p>The aim of this research study is to shed light about the correlation of these two concepts and to design a computational model of mental workload assessment that will be tested with user studies and empirically evaluated in the context of web-design.</p>

This project aims to study the impact of defeasible reasoning and formal models of AT for enhancing the representation of the ill-defined construct of human mental workload (MLW), an important interaction design concept in human-computer interaction (HCI). The argumentation theory approach will be compared against other knowledge-representation approaches.</p>

It is aimed at increasing the reliability, trust and performance of electronic communities and online information. Computer science has moved, in the last decades, from the paradigm of isolated machines to the paradigm of networks and distributed computing. Similarly, Artificial Intelligence is quickly shifting from the paradigm of isolated and non-situated intelligence to the paradigm of situated, collective and social intelligence. This new paradigm as well as the emergence of the information society technologies are responsible for the increasing interest on trust and reputation techniques applied to public online information, communities and social networks. This study is aimed at invetigating the nature of trust, the factors that affect trust of online information and the design of a computational model for assessing trust. This will be evaluated in empirical terms with user studies involving several online web-sites and people.</p>

<p><strong><a name="pointcloud"></a>Storage And Indexing of Large Point Cloud Data</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) data has become increasingly available, in part as a result of significant technological progresses in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR).&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />LiDAR provides longitude and latitude information delivered in conjunction with a GPS device, and elevation information generated by a pulse or phase laser scanner, which together provide an effective way of acquiring accurate 3D information of a terrestrial or manmade feature. The main advantages of LiDAR over conventional surveying methods lie in the high accuracy of the data and the relatively little time needed to scan large geographical areas. LiDAR scans provide a vast amount of data points that result in especially rich, complex point clouds. Spatial Information Systems (SISs) are critical to the hosting , querying, and analysing of such data sets. Feature-rich SISs have been well-documented.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />However, the implementation of support for 3D capabilities in such systems is only recently been addressed. And large point cloud data is not their main focal point. This project aims to overcome shortcomings of current technology and provides support for storing, querying and analysing LiDAR data without the need of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) or Triangular Irregular Networks (TINs), but harvesting the information in its point cloud nature.</p>

<p><strong><a name="spatialdata"></a>Spatial Data Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Lineage, positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, completeness and semantic accuracy are just some of the quality assessment dimensions used to determine the quality of spatial data. Naturally, cartographers have been traditionally most occupied with the quality of spatial data. More recently though, most likely through the relatively novel spatial data acquisition, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), spatial data quality is an issue that now interests a myriad of disciplines. Being enveloped as a a subset of the recent big data explosion, the increasing ease of using and providing spatial data means that spatial data statistics are an increasingly important area of research. For example, geographically weighted regression (GWR) is one of the techniques used to explain relationships between variables that otherwise cannot be explained with global models.&nbsp;<br />This research harnesses the emergence of multiple spatial data sources for meaningful statistical data analysis.</p>

<p><strong><a name="highperfsa"></a>High Performance Spatial Analytics</strong></p>
<p class="normal">For the last decade the importance and pervasiveness of spatial data has been repeatedly mentioned in the media as well as research publications. Everyday Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have gained popularity mainly through satellite navigation devices and software for phones. The availability of spatial data has increased likewise with an increase of diverse, socially volunteered spatial information either as a by-product of human communication or specifically on platforms such as OpenStreetMap. This in combination with the general big data trend, means that we now face the positive challenge of analysing these large and diverse spatial data sets in a meaningful way.</p>
<p class="normal">Gaining inspiration from the non-spatial domain for large data analysis we see a trend shift from traditional relational databases with their data warehouses towards a combination of relational databases with NoSQL and MapReduce systems to aid with the management and analysis of large datasets. Spatial databases have been around for several decades, and they have certainly evolved to strong maturity and widespread usage as standalone systems and as a backend to GIS, that would have traditionally mainly relied on file based data management. The spatial research community is slowly exploring NoSQL capabilities for management and analytics of spatial information. Some first efforts to incorporate MapReduce for spatial data warehouses have emerged. Advantages of NoSQL and MapReduce certainly lie in their flexible data schemas and massive parallel processing capabilities.</p>
<p>This project proposes to advance knowledge in this particular area with a view to combine traditional spatial database syestem with NoSQL for better spatial analytics and consequently, faster near real-time decision making. Specifically, this research is interested in using NoSQL graph databases for relationship analysis of volunteered spatial data. The need for such research arose from the very advantage that crowd-sourced spatial data brought: multiple sources referencing the same urban structure or spatial location; which often results in poor recognition of their commonalities and relationships.</p>

<p class="normal"><strong><a name="spatialdataiot"></a>Spatial Data Models for IoT Real-Time Data Analytics</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The Internet of Things (IoT) finds more and more adoption since the term was first coined in the late 1990s. It describes an idea that machines, sensors and devices would work together and independelty to measure and analyse their environment. Since then the IoT has slowly started to pervade everyday life. The IoT enjos far reaching popularity particularly as part of the WHO Healthy Cities Network initiative and within the smarter cities community, as can be seen by a showcasing of the city of Barcelona, Spain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The IoT produces a wide range of data that needs to be stored and further analysed. This data can be diverse from weather information, to usage levels of garbage bins and noise measurements. All of these various data sources have in common that they rely on a geographic location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">Databases are often used for storing large sets of data, especially where concurrent and web access needs to be facilitated. Since the inception of databases in the late 1970s, database models have always had one goal: to accommodate the purpose of the specific data usage. For example, Entity Relationship Models are used specifically for transactional processing, whereas we have seen different models emerge for analytics purposes in data warehouses (star schema and snowflake schema). Spatial Databases are used for the storing and access management of data that is of a spatial nature. Our spatially related sensor and location data from the IoT benefits from this technology. A successful IoT network needs high-velocity data ingestions, spatial data models and analytics and real-time query execution.</p>
<p>Data models for Spatial Databases are typically categorised into either vector or raster data, and can be discrete or continuous (though vector data does not lend itself very well to storing continuous data). Originally, these models have been built for relatively small datasets that change slowly. The IoT provides the opposite, and thus new spatial data models are needed to accommodate this exciting use case.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a name="contextmerge"></a>Context Merge from Crowd-Sourced Spatial Data</strong></p>
<p>This project makes a contribution in the area of aggregating and merging crowd-sourced&nbsp;information&nbsp;in&nbsp;order to integrate text, image and spatial data layers. The recent decade has seen an unprecedented surge in publicly available crowd-sourced data and even large companies, such as Google have started to embrace the potential in their Google maps traffic information feature. Crowd-sourced projects have&nbsp;enjoyed&nbsp;a wide recognition and&nbsp;utilisation&nbsp;since&nbsp;having&nbsp;been mentioned in as such for the first time around&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html" target="_blank">2006 in Wire magazine</a>. It describes the phenomenon of a group of people of the general public providing resources and time in order to accomplish a project.</p>
<p>Nearly in parallel, we see that service providers of traditionally only text-based information carriers, such as twitter, have started to incorporate location to their feeds. On one side this novel opportunity to harness new sources of crowd-sourced spatial information is promising. On the other side, the biggest challenge lies in merging spatial information that references the same location or spatial structure, but originates from heterogeneous data sources in order to perform meaningful analysis. This project bridges this gap by designing novel techniques for spatial context merge.</p>

<p>A large number of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) exist which can be used by clinicians to support their role in healthcare. However,recent changes to international regulations i.e. European and FDA,regarding the development of such software has resulted in a large number of these applications being banned from use as they do not adhere to the current regulations. Currently, there is only a small number of CDSS which have been approved for use in a clinical environment. The producers of these applications have provided the necessary information to regulatory bodies proving the safety and effectiveness of their&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>This research will develop a CDSS which can be executed on a mobile&nbsp;device. Currently, only one CDSS application designed for a mobile&nbsp;device is approved for use within the EU. A CDSS will be developed in&nbsp;accordance with the current international medical device software&nbsp;standards such as IEC 62304 and ISO 13485, and regulations such as FDA&nbsp;CFR 21 820 Part 21 and MDD 2007/47/EC, to accompany this a roadmap will&nbsp;be produced which CDSS development organisations can follow when&nbsp;developing regulatory compliant software.</p>

<p><strong><a name="knowtrans"></a>University-Industry linkages for Software Innovation<br /></strong></p>
<p>Software innovation includes advances in products, processes or services and occurs in all sectors of the economy. Disruptive technologies such as mobile, cloud computing and web 2.0 have transformed the software sector in recent years making much previous research obsolete. OECD research from 18 countries showed that young Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are primarily responsible up to 42% of total job creation over the last decade. SMEs represent 90% of all businesses in the European Union<sup>&nbsp;</sup>for example. SMEs have distinctive characteristics and are often at a disadvantage when competing for skills and talent with larger firms, particularly multinationals in the ICT sector. Effective knowledge flow between centres of software innovation expertise and the companies that need this expertise is therefore critical for economic success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few research studies empirically examine the role of universities in innovation by discipline or by industry&nbsp;although the disciplines and the environment in which knowledge is produced are known to be important factors in knowledge transfer&nbsp;and innovation. The range of potential mechanisms for University-Industry Linkages is extensive &ndash; including collaborative projects; student projects; contract research; scientific publications; patents; technology licences; incubation space, sponsorship of postgraduates, participation in conferences and other networking events. Some mechanisms are more effective than others however and we need to determine which activities work best for in U-I linkages for software innovation for the SME sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Working with over ten international partners based in major ICT hubs in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, this research will build on existing research by focussing on the distinctive dynamics of U-I linkages for software innovation. It will develop and evaluate a U-I model(s) which ensures SMEs in all sectors can access software innovation expertise available in universities in an effective way.</p>

<p><strong><a name="managing"></a>Managing complex interdisciplinary research projects</strong></p>
<p>The complexity of the challenges facing our societies and economies is increasing and solving them requires large-scale, interdisciplinary and international approaches.&nbsp;Much of the research in the European Union, through&nbsp; its pillar programmes (H2020 and others), is characterised by large, complex, interdisciplinary, international and inter-sectoral research projects.&nbsp;To be successful, these projects need to be strategically planned, actively managed and quality-assured across many dimensions including diverse stakeholders, sectors, countries, academic disciplines. Internal integration across work packages and deliverables is also critical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such complex research projects have distinctive characteristics which present challenges for their management including (i) ill-defined outcomes due to the nature of research (ii) the balance between maintaining a strategic focus and ensuring disciplinary integrity (iii) the diverse and temporary team of independent partners based in multiple international locations (iv) the increasing emphasis on interdisciplinary research which brings together researchers from disparate disciplines and methodological backgrounds and (v) the involvement of stakeholders from multiple sectors (higher education, large companies, SMEs, NGOs, government agencies&nbsp;<em>etc.</em>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Leading, well-established, project management methodologies in the commercial sector explicitly include integration of project activities as a core project management activity. Project integration must be managed in the same way as costs, risk, quality and schedule. It is arguably one of the most critical aspects of research project management to ensure the impact of research is exploited fully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;However project management methodologies which take into account the challenges of complex research projects are under-developed as is the management of interdisciplinary research projects in general. By using case studies of several major EU-funded research projects, this research aims to contribute towards the development of a comprehensive management framework for the integration of complex interdisciplinary research projects. This framework will be informed by state-of-the-art evidence from four key areas (i) integrating interdisciplinary research (ii) integrating multiple sectors (iii) integrating diverse stakeholders (iv) integrating international research teams.</p>

<p><strong>Transient Distributed Supercomputer Clouds using Mobile Devices</strong></p>
<p>Science based data processing requirements have grown from terabytes to petabytes over the last 10 years, with exabyte sized data projects currently under development. The computing power required to process this volume of data primarily relies on high-end supercomputer clusters which are purpose built, expensive to maintain and often inflexible in terms of the service they provide.&nbsp; Measured in Teraflops, the required processing power of the most powerful parallel supercomputers will struggle to process this impending tsunami of scientific data. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This research aims to investigate how a global data processing cloud can be constructed which horizontally scales using mobile devices to process scientific data at supercomputer processing rates. This distributed parallel processing supercomputer should be easily created and destroyed, allowing different types of scientific data to be processed as required. This distributed supercomputer would also incorporate security protocols, be resilient to individual node failure, and operate using an economic model &nbsp;which supported spot price bidding to control processing costs. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a name="automon"></a>Automated Monitoring of Group Environment</strong></p>
<p>In nursing home and other assistive group environments, situations arise where residents&rsquo; standard of care is substandard &ndash; such as the verbal or physical abuse of patients by staff or lack of adequate exercise for patients. Initial solutions to external monitoring of these environments suggest use of cameras [<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/28/care-homes-chain-to-use-cctv-residents-rooms-to-stop-abuse-hc-one">1</a>][<a href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/moves-to-install-cameras-in-care-homes-303558.html">2</a>] but this poses problems of privacy and manual effort to analyse camera footage.</p>
<p>In such situations, we need solution(s) that deliver real time alerts and/or post incident analysis &nbsp;- using several streams of information &ndash; including visual, auditory and activity information from sensors. The interpretation of this sensor information needs to be<em>&nbsp;correct</em>&nbsp;in identifying abusive incidents and&nbsp;<em>fast,&nbsp;</em>so that such problems are identified as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For example, auditory signals from a microphone can monitor noise levels in a room.&nbsp; Audio patterns that are associated with incidents, such as raised voices can be captured and classified using learning algorithms.&nbsp; Pressure sensors can be used to detect the length of time spent in bed &ndash;and so build up an activity profile for a resident &ndash; with any change in typical patterns highlighted.&nbsp; Camera images cannot rely on manual monitoring so require automated image processing to pick up patterns associated with problem incidents.&nbsp; These problems require investigation and use of&nbsp;<em>image processing&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>machine learning techniques</em>&nbsp;to develop improved and new algorithms for detection of scenarios of interest.</p>
<p>In summary, the overall purpose of this project is to investigate and develop a set of solutions to assist in automated monitoring of group environments.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions, sound quality using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is superior to regular fixed line or mobile phone calls. However the fidelity gains in terms of natural sounding wideband speech can often be out-weighted by cut-outs, delays or echo caused by network or connectivity problems. This project will use machine-learning techniques to develop classification algorithms to monitor VoIP calls for speech quality issues. These algorithms will be combined into a computer model that implements real-time monitoring and prediction of speech quality.</p>

VoIP is becoming more prevalent on mobile devices, increasing the opportunities for voice and video communication. Increased availability along with improved quality and reliability make VoIP services a viable alternative to traditional telephony.<br /><br />For hearing impaired users the issue of speech intelligibility and understanding a speaker are a higher priority than the sound quality of the experience. This is equally true of users of hearing aids and cochlear implants. The aim of this project is to use computer models of the auditory periphery to evaluate intelligibility for hearing impaired listeners using VoIP systems. By analysing speech signals with computer based intelligibility and quality metrics. The project will explore new ways of maximising intelligibility and quality of experience for hearing impaired users.</p>

Narrative devices, such as maintaining intrigue and using &ldquo;The Big Reveal&rdquo;, have emerged as an innovative way to engage passive readers. Given the increasing amounts of data being generated daily, and the broad spectrum of visual literacy for regular web users, there is scope to investigate how visual narratives could be automatically generated from a range of differing datasets. These automated visual narratives must consider the application domain, the role and expertise of the reader while applying narrative structures that generate insightful and interesting data stories. Machine learning techniques, such as Deep Learning, and novel visualisation interfaces will be used to support the creation of visual narratives during this research.</p>

<p><strong><a name="semiautovisnarr"></a>Semi-automated Visual Analytics for Non-expert users</strong></p>
<p>The emergence of Big Data and the turn to data-driven decision-making has created a need for data analytics to be embedded in every aspect of modern business. In many cases, this has resulted in analytics software being adopted by a less analytically-orientated user who may not have a background in statistics but has the required domain knowledge to make effective business decisions. However, often the sheer size and complexity of data can result in a user relying on surface-level analysis, applying default analytic procedures or representing data incorrectly with visualisation. The current generation of visual analytics tools include some level of chart recommendation, based on the dimensionality and type of data for example, yet there remains significant scope to research how users can be assisted during the visual analytics process. This could include amending the interface automatically to emphasise key characteristics in data, using the history of previous analytic sessions to highlight insights or automatically re-encoding visual variables based on a user&rsquo;s level of expertise. The aim of this project is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, such as Deep Learning, to investigate how semi-automated visual analytics can be effectively implemented for non-expert users.</p>

<p><strong><a name="interinva"></a>Measuring the impact of interactivity in Visual Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Visual Analytics is the use of visualisation to support analytic reasoning. Over the last decade, Visual Analytics has enabled users with varying degrees of expertise to gain insights into large volumes of data. Interactivity is considered a core component of Visual Analytics, allowing users to think about data from different perspectives, encode variables in new ways or reconfigure visual elements into different visualisation views. Interactivity is increasingly used with animation as a way to illustrate trends or highlight potential correlations. Popular approaches, such as Hans Rosling&rsquo;s Gap Minder, have caught the public imagination and shown that interactive animation is an effective means of storytelling. However, the impact of interactivity for insight generation is less well understood. This research seeks to investigate this question by asking how interactivity can support the development of insight for users engaged in visual analytics.</p>

<p><strong><a name="vafordl"></a>Visual Analytics for Large Digital Libraries</strong></p>
<p>Despite the emergence of digital media, text-based libraries remain the primary means of storing and disseminating knowledge. Although these libraries house huge amounts of data, abstracted to vary degrees of information and knowledge, the primary means of user interaction remains search-based in which a ranked list of candidate resources is returned based on a free-form text search. Although there has been previous research in addressing library visualisation, often the profile of the user has been neglected or the application interface have focused too acutely on the role of exploration. To address this gap, the aim of the project is to research new visual interfaces for large digital libraries. The project will consider advances in the field of visual analytics, when addressing large text corpora with machine learning (Deep Learning) for example, representing the connection between concepts in text documents or using new visual mechanisms to illustrate trends at different conceptual levels. The project will focus on specific user roles, such as librarian, student, professor, and seek to develop novel visual mechanisms and interfaces that support those specific roles. The effectiveness of these novel visual interfaces will then be analysed through experimentation and in-depth user studies.</p>

<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture that is dynamic, manageable, cost-effective, and adaptable, making it ideal for the high-bandwidth, dynamic nature of today's applications. This architecture decouples the network control and forwarding functions enabling the network control to become directly programmable and the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted for applications and network services. On the other hand, Self Adaptive Software is a Dynamic and intelligent software that can adapts its behavior &amp; functionality based on the computational environment where they are executed.

<p>Smartphones are become the true physical personal assistants. Third-party &lsquo;apps&rsquo; provide users with nearly no limits to share user-generated content (i.e. Email, SMS, Chat Messages, Pictures, Audio). A large amount of those content are not processed in the Device locally, due to the limited resources available on Mobile devices. Natural Language Processing (NLP) can help to make apps smarter, dynamic and intelligent by automatically analyzing the meaning of content and taking appropriate actions on behalf of their users. However, due to its complexity, NLP has yet to find widespread adoption in smartphone or tablet applications rather than sending user&rsquo;s sensitive data to backend service running on the cloud. The question on mind is what if we blend together the output of local NLP framework and Context Awareness for extending software&rsquo;s smart functionality.</p>

<p><strong><a name="usingsdm"></a>Using Sparse Distributed Memory to transform Human long Term Memory from One Mobile User to Another</strong></p>
<p>Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) was developed as a mathematical model of human long-term Memory. How we can use SDM to index the Human knowledge and transform this generated knowledge from Human to Human. This corresponds beautifully to how humans and animals with advanced sensory systems and brains work. The signals received by us at two different times are hardly ever identical, and yet we can identify the source of the signal as a specific individual, object, place, scene, or thing. In smaller scale Mobile Devices has less sensory systems and the reaction to those sensory events is pre defined by software Developers. Could we use SDM to index those sensory events and User Generated Content to improve/predict both Mobile Users and software reactions as an optimal response for a specific events and Content. In addition to that, If we manage to build a real time index about the user long-term memory is it possible to transform this knowledge to another users, so they can use it as a source of learning and they will possibility adapt the same optimal reaction!</p>

<p><strong><a name="fake"></a>Automated identification of fake users profiles in online media</strong></p>
<p>The volume of social media content posted by users has grown enormously over the past decade. One of the challenges for social media providers is to validate user profile information against true user profiles. For example, children who claim to be older gain access to site and content by creating users profiles with false age information. Other false information can include gender or location.</p>
<p>This project processes to address this problem by automatically identifying risky user profiles &ndash; i.e. by developing a mechanism for analysing user content which does not match the declare user profile. This will involve developing particular activity or content profiles associated with specific user profiles &ndash; using machine learning techniques. The output of the project will be of interest to any social media or general media business on the internet. The technologies will include machine learning techniques and text mining.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Detection of abusive content in social media in a multi lingual environment</strong><a name="abusivemultilingual"></a></strong></p>
<p>There has been enormous growth in the volume of user content posted to social media such as Twitter, Instagram , Facebook and YouTube. A major challenge for this media is to monitor and prevent the posting of abusive user content, be this bullying content or other types of abusive text content. Research work in this area is ongoing. A particular gap, however, is the detection of content across multiple languages, as the tendency is to focus on English. This project looks at addressing both the detection of abusive content, and the challenge of doing this while taking account of multiple languages. The techniques that will be used on the project include machine learning for building automated modules for categorising content &ndash; and text mining for the parsing and analysis of text.</p>

<p>There has been enormous growth in the volume of video material posted on the internet for public and private consumption. For example, 300 hours of new video footage is uploaded to YouTube every minute [1]. A major challenge for businesses is to process the volume of uploaded video content. The video content needs to be classified into safe versus abusive content &ndash; and further into genres such as news, sports, comedy and education. Current methods focus heavily on visual and /or text content of video, with less focus on including embedded audio content [2]. This project initially proposes to use an audio-led machine learning approach to classification, based on the premise that the audio content of a digital audio-visual segment will provide rich information for classification. We will enhance our approach through exploring the latest techniques in image content for building classification features. The student will have the freedom to explore new mechanisms for improving video classification results.</p>

<p><a name="sdn"></a><strong>High-Security, High-Performance Software Defined Networks</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Software Defined Networks (SDNs) will address the needs for flexibility and speed in meeting increased bandwidth requirements. SDNs are part of the evolution toward &ldquo;X&rdquo; as a Service (XaaS). &nbsp;With the rapid integration of SDNs, a paradigm shift in network infrastructure is occurring. No longer are infrastructural works confined to fixed routes controlled by hardware. Instead, SDNs provide capabilities to redefine the network using software abstraction. SDNs are now doing in software what could be previously only managed by hardware (routing, switching, forwarding) with the main advantages of being quick to re-design using inexpensive hardware. They have the ability to provide a quick mechanism to fix security issues such (as the Heartbleed bug) as well as rapidly responding to new routing configurations as the network evolves. This can be achieved by making use of a feature known as &ldquo;experimental protocol&rdquo; support. In addition to this, major technology companies (such as Oracle, Cisco and Google) have acquired SDN technology and entrusted it to manage its infrastructure and data warehouses. Their ability to reconfigure makes them well suited for power and resource management of large scale virtual systems in data warehouses. SDNs introduce a number of security vulnerabilities across its platform which are not present in traditional networks. The centralised control mechanism at the heart of to SDNs means that these issues can have catastrophic effects. This could lead to manipulation of the SDN controller itself or actual traffic through the SDN controller which would allows an attacker to gain full control of a network topology. In essence, attackers can shift their focus from the host to the entire network. By identifying the vulnerabilities of the SDN platform a solution can be implemented to prevent security attacks. Furthermore, rich sources of dynamic social media data can be used to predict vulnerabilities before they have been identified. Any such implementation to address SDN issues should be efficient so that they do not impact heavily on network performance. The main challenge is to design the system which trades-off security against performance to provide sufficient efficiency. The main areas of research we are considering are SDN Security, SDN Routing, SDN Quality of Service,&nbsp; SDN Power management.</p>

<p><strong><a name="stem"></a>Developing STEM Teaching Methods Through Modular Design</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The aim of this project is to develop STEM/science capital through the use of a modular based training and teaching system for primary education (age 4 - age 12). Science capital refers to science-related qualifications, understanding, knowledge (about science and &ldquo;how it works&rdquo;), interest and social contacts (e.g. knowing someone who works in a science-related job). There is evidence that children who do not engage with STEM disciplines before the age of 8 are unlikely to engage with STEM later on or choose a career path in STEM. While there are many educational programs to support STEM at secondary level, we believe that an approach to encourage early childhood engagement which also provides support for families would be largely beneficial. The aim of this research is to develop bespoke modular teaching which can be adapted in line with technology advancements. Preliminary consultations with primary schools have identified a number of aspects to teaching STEM in the classroom which prove challenging. A major part of this not just the content but how the content is delivered. Practical problem based learning of STEM related subjects are often too abstract for young children to work unaccompanied. Current trends in IT based assistive technology are indicating a proliferation of smart speaker systems (Google Home, Amazon Echo etc). Such devices may be utilised as learning support in classrooms to aid in providing information to small groups of children whilst at the same time integrating technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The main deliverable from this research would be to provide a detailed and comprehensive study of primary school children's ability in STEM and to design and implement a STEM teaching pedagogy which is highly adaptable and accessible to teachers and parents.</p>
